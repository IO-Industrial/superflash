        //!
        //! A "handle" is a generic identifier for an arbitrary device or piece of information.
        //! In the case of USB, a "USB handle" is an identifier for a USB device.
        //! It is passed to further USB API functions in order to interact with
        //! the USB device.
        //!
        //! This class wraps a USB handle, a device handle is used to perform I/O and other
        //! operations. When finished with a device handle, you should call libusb_close().

            //! - 1024 or less bytes for high-speed
