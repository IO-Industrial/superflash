        //!
        //! - 1ms and 255ms for full and low-speed
        //! - 125Î¼s to 4096ms for high-speed endpoints.
        //!
        //! The maximum packet size for the interrupt endpoint data is:
        //!
        //! - 64 or less bytes for full-speed
        //! - 1024 or less bytes for high-speed
